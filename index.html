        <p>
          Developed at Bell Laboratories by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s C is a high-level programming language
          that is known for its efficiency, portability, and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>It is often referred to as the mother of programming language, a middle-level language because it combines
          elements of both high-level and low-level languages. C has influenced the development of many other
          programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system, therefore making it an ideal language for developing operating systems.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Features of C programming:</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>C programming possesses several notable features that have contributed to its enduring popularity:</p>
          <li>
            Portability: C programs can run on a wide range of computer systems with minimal modification. This
            portability is due to the ANSI C standard, which defines the languages syntax and semantics. As long as a
            system has a C compiler that adheres to this standard, C code can be compiled and executed without major
            issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efficiency: C is known for its ability to produce highly efficient code. It allows low-level memory
            manipulation and direct access to hardware, which is crucial in systems programming and embedded systems
            developficiency makes C an ideal choice for developing operating systems, device drivers, and
            performance-critical applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flexibility: C provides a wide range of data types, operators, and libraries, allowing programmers to have
            fine-grained control over their code. This flexibility enables developers to write code that closely matches
            the problem they are trying to solve, making C suitable for a wide variety of applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rich Standard Library: C comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides functions for common
            operations like input/output, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations. These library functions
            save time and effort for programmers by offering pre-built solutions to common programming tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Community support: C has a vast and active community of developers, which means there are numerous online
            resources, forums, and libraries available for those learning or working with C. This community support
            makes it easier to find help and resources when needed.
          </li>

            It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
          </li>
          <li>
            If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programsuch as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as
            the syntax is similar</li>
          <li>
            Helps to under the fundamentals of Computer Theories. Most of the theories related to computers like
            Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on C programming
            language and requires a good knowledge of C programming if you are working on them. In the modern high level
            languages, the machine level details are hidden from the user, so in order to work with CPU cache, memory,
            network adapters, learning C programming is a must.</li>
          <li>
            C is a Middle-Level Language. The middle-level languages are somewhere between the Low-level machine
            understandable assembly languages and High-Level user friendly languages. Being a middle-level language, C
            reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages. It can be used for writing operating systems
            as well as doing application level programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            C is very fast execution time. Programs written and compiled in C execute much faster than compared to any
            other programming language. C programming language is very fast in terms of execution as it does not have
            any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks etc. The
            programmer must take care of these things on his own.
          </li>
          <li>
            Embedded Programming C is extensively used in Embedded Programming. Embedded Programming is also referred to
            as micro-controller programming, where C program is used to control micro-controllers. Microcontrollers and
            embedded programming is widely used in auto-motives, Robotics, Hardware etc.

          C and C++ are both widely used programming languages, with C being a procedural language and C++ being a
          superset of C with additional features, including object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities. C is known
          for its simplicity and efficiency, often used for system programming and developing low-level software such as
          operating systems and device drivers. C++ builds upon C by adding features like classes, inheritance,
          polymorphism, and templates, making it suitable for a broader range of applications including game
          development, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and large-scale software systems. Despite their differences,
          both languages are powerful tools with their own strengths and are commonly used in the software industry.

      <header>Getting Started With C</header>
      <article>
        <p>To start using C, you need two things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand</li>
          <li>A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
          There are many text editors and compilers to choose from in this tutorial we will use an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe/download">CodeBlocks</a>.

          Let's create our first C file.
        <br>
        Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
        <br>
        Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as):
        </p>
        <code>
            #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdio.h&RightAngleBracket;
            #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdlib.h&RightAngleBracket;
            
            int main(void){
               &MediumSpace;printf("Hello World!");
               &MediumSpace;return 0;

            return 0;
            } 
          </code>
        <p>
          Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example Explained</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Line 1:<span>#include &LeftAngleBracket;stdio.h&RightAngleBracket;</span> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such
              as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line 3: Anothe that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its
            curly brackets <span id="marked">{}</span> will be executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example, it will output
            "Hello World!".
          <code id="note">Note that: Every C statement ends with a semicolon <span id="marked">;</span>
           
              Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
              int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}
           
              Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
          </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function
          </li>
          <li>
            Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket <span id="marked">&rbrace;</span> to actually end the main function.

    <section class="main-section" id="statements">
      <header>Statements</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
          <br>
        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. e.g.
        </p>
        <code>
            printf("Hello World!");

            return 0;
        </code>
        <p>
          Most C programs contain many statements.
        <br>
        The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written: e.g
        </p>
        <code>
            printf("Hello World!");
            printf("You are getting there.");

            return 0;
        </code>
        <p>
          It is important that you end the statement with a semicolon <span id="marked">;</span>
        <br>
        If you forget the semicolon (;), an error will occur and the program will not run.
        </p>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution
        when testing alternative code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
      <h3>Single-line Comments</h3>
      <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes <span id="marked">//</span>.
        <br>
        Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
        <br>
        This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:
      <code>
        // This is a comment
        printf("Hello World!");
      </code>
      <h3>Multi-line comments</h3>
      <p>
        Multi-line comments start with <span id="marked">/*</span> and ends with <span id="marked">*/</span>.
        <br>
        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler.
        Example:
      </p>
      <code>
          /* The code below will print the words Hello World!
          to the screen, and it is amazing */
          printf("Hello World!");

      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
          <p>
            A variable is a name given to data in computing, Variables are for storing data values, like numbers and
          characters.
          <br>
          In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span id="marked">int</span> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
          <li><span id="marked">char</span> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes</li>
          <li><span id="marked">float</span> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
        <p>
          To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:
        </p>
        <code> 
          type variableName = value;
          &MediumSpace;int myNum = 42;
          &MediumSpace;float myNum = 42.3;
          &MediumSpace;char myLetter = 'a';
        </code>
        <p>
          Note that in C you have to enclose none numerical values within single quotes <span id="marked">''</span>
          <br>
          Where type is C types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The
          equal sign <span id="marked">=</span> is used to assign a value to the variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:
        </p>
          <code>
            //Declare a variable 
            int myNum;

            //Assign a value to the variable 
            myNum = 15;
          </code>
        <p>
          In many other programming languages (like Python, Java, and C++), you would normally use a print function to
          display the value of a variable. However, this is not possible in C:
          <br>
          To output variables in C, you must get familiar with something called <a href="#format_specifier">format specifiers</a>, which you will learn about in the next chapter.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="format_specifiers">
      <header>Format Specifiers</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Format specifiers are used together with the printf() function to tell the compiler what type of data the
          variable is storing. It is basically a placeholder for the variable value.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          A format specifier starts with a percentage sign <span id="marked">%</span>, followed by a character.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          For example, to output the value of an int variable, use the format specifier <span id="marked">%d</span> surrounded by double quotes
          (<span id="marked">""</span>), inside the printf() function:
        </p>
        <code>
          int myNum = 15;
          printf("%d", myNum);  // Outputs 15
        </code>
        <br>
        <p>
          To print other types, use <span id="marked">%c</span> for char and <span id="marked">%f</span> for float:
        </p>
          <code>
            // Create variables
            &MediumSpace;int myNum = 15;           // Integer (whole number)
            &MediumSpace;float myFloatNum = 5.99;  // Floating point number
            &MediumSpace;char myLetter = 'D';       // Characters

            // Print variables
            &MediumSpace;printf("%d
", myNum);
            &MediumSpace;printf("%f
", myFloatNum);
            &MediumSpace;printf("%c
", myLetter);

            return 0;
          </code>
        <p>
          To combine both text and a variable, separate them with a comma inside the printf() function:
        </p>
          <code>
            int myNum = 15;
            printf("My favorite number is: %d", myNum);
          </code>
        <p>
          To print different types in a single printf() function, you can use the following:
        </p>
          <code>
            int myNum = 15;
            char myLetter = 'D';
            printf("My number is %d and my letter is %c", myNum, myLetter);
        </code>
        <h2>Changing Variable Values</h2>
        <p>
          If you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:
        </p>
          <code>
            int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
            myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
          </code>
        <p>You can also assign the value of one variable to another:</p>
          <code>
            int myNum = 15;
            int myOtherNum = 23;

            // Assign the value of myOtherNum (23) to myNum
            myNum = myOtherNum;

            // myNum is now 23, instead of 15
            printf("%d", myNum);
          </code>
        <p>Or copy values to empty variables:</p>
          <code>
            // Create a variable and assign the value 15 to it
            int myNum = 15;

            // Declare a variable without assigning it a value
            int myOtherNum;

            // Assign the value of myNum to myOtherNum
            myOtherNum = myNum;

            // myOtherNum now has 15 as a value
            printf("%d", myOtherNum);
          </code>
        <h2>Adding Variables Together</h2>
        <p>
          To add a variable to another variable, you can use the <span id="marked">+</span> operator:
        </p>
          <code>
            int x = 5;
            int y = 6;
            int sum = x + y;

            printf("%d", sum);
          </code>
        </p>
        <h2>Declaring Multiple Variables</h2>
        <p>
          To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
        </p>
          <code>
            int x = 5, y = z = 50;

            printf("%d", x + y + z);
          </code>
          <p>
            You can also assign the same value to multiple variables of the same type:
          </p>
          <code>
            int x, y, z;
            x = y = z = 50;

            printf("%d", x + y + z);
          </code>
        <h2>Variable Names</h2>
        <p>
          All C variables must be identified with unique names.
          <br>
          These unique names are called identifiers.
          <br>
          Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
          <br>
          Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:
        </p>
          <code>
            // Good variable name
            int minutesPerHour = 60;

            // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually issues
            int m = 60;
          </code>
        <p>The general rules for naming variables are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Names can contain letters, digits and underscores</li>
          <li>Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)</li>
          <li>Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)</li>
          <li>Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/developer-for-zos/14.2?topic=programs-c-reserved-keywords" target="_blank" >Reserved words</a> (such as int) cannot be used as names</li>
        </ul>

      <header>Real Life Examples</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Often in our examples, we simplify variable names to match their data type (myInt or myNum for int types,
          myChar for char types, and so on). This is done to avoid confusion.
          <br>
          However, if you want a real-life example of how variables can be used, take a look at the following, where we
          have made a program that stores different data of a college student:
        </p>
        <code>
            #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdio.h&RightAngleBracket;
            #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdlib.h&RightAngleBracket;

            int main(){
            // Student data
            &MediumSpace;int studentID = 15;
            &MediumSpace;int studentAge = 23;
            &MediumSpace;float studentFee = 75.25;
            &MediumSpace;char studentGrade = 'B';

            // Print variablesprintf("Student id: %d
", studentID);
            &MediumSpace;printf("Student age: %d
", studentAge);
            &MediumSpace;printf("Student fee: %f
", studentFee);
            &MediumSpace;printf("Student grade: %c
", studentGrade);
            
            return 0;
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          In this real-life example, we create a program to calculate the area of a rectangle (by multiplying the length
          and width):
        </p>
          <code>
              #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdio.h&RightAngleBracket;
              #include &LeftAngleBracket;stdlib.h&RightAngleBracket;

              int main(){
              // Create integer variables
              &MediumSpace;int length = 4;
              &MediumSpace;int width = 6;
              &MediumSpace;int area;

              // Calculate the area of a rectangle area = length * width;
              // Print the variables
              &MediumSpace;printf("Length is: %d
", length);
              &MediumSpace;printf("Width is: %d
", width);

              &MediumSpace;printf("Area of the rectangle is: %d", area);

              return 0;
            }

      <p>
        As explained in the <a href="#variables">variable chapter</a>, a variable in C must be a specified data type,
        and you must use a format specifier inside the printf() function to display it.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of data types in C</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Primary Data Types</h3>
        <p>
          The C programming language has five primitive or primary data types.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span id="marked">Integer (int):</span> Refers to positive and negative whole numbers (without decimal), such as 10, 12, 65, 3400, etc 
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <span id="marked">Character (char):</span> Refers to all the ASCII character sets within single quotes such as ‘a’, ‘A’, etc.

            <p>
              Note: If you try to store more than a single character, it will only print the last Character

        <h3>Data Type Modifiers</h3>
        <p>
          Modifiers are C keywords that modify the meaning of fundamental data types. It indicates how much memory will
          be allocated to a variable. Modifiers are prefixed with fundamental data types to adjust the memory allocated
          for a variable. C Programming Language has four data type modifiers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            long
          </li>
          <li>
            short
          </li>
          <li>
            signed
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsigned
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These modifiers make the memory required for primary data types more precise.</p>
        <h3>Size Of Data Types In C</h3>
        <p>
          The size of each data type is defined in bits or bytes (8 bits). Each data type in C is associated with a
          specific range of values defined as below:
        </p>
        <div class="range-table">

        <h2>Derived Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          Derived data types are primary data types that are grouped together. You can group many elements of similar
          data types. These data types are defined by the user. The following are the derived data types in C:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Array</li>
          <li>Pointers</li>
          <li>Structure</li>
          <li>Union</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Boolean Data Types</h2>
        <p>These (Derived and Boolean Data Types) will be discussed more in the later chapters</p>
        <h2>Void Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          The void is just an empty data type that depicts that no value is available. Typically, the void is used for
          functions. When we declare a function as void, it doesn’t have to return anything.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>Void is used in three situations:</p>
          <li>Function returns as void – A function with no return value will have the return type as void.</li>
          <li>Function arguments as void – A function with no parameter can accept the void.</li>
          <li>Pointers to void – It represents the address of an object, but not its type.</li>
          <code>
            //This function will not return any value to the calling function.
            void sum(int a, int b)
          </code>
        </ul>

      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
        If you don't want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, you can use the const keyword.
        <br>
        This will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only:
        </p>
        <code>
            const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
            myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'
        </code>
        <p>You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:</p>
        <code>
            const int minutesPerHour = 60;
            const float PI = 3.14;
        </code>
        <p>When you declare a constant variable, it must be assigned with a value:</p>
        <code>
            //like this
            const int minutesPerHour = 60;

            //This however, will not work:
            const int minutesPerHour;
            minutesPerHour = 60; // error
        </code>
        <p>
          Another thing about constant variables, is that it is considered good practice to declare them with uppercase.
          <br>
          It is not required, but useful for code readability and common for C programmers: 
        </p>
        <code>
            const int BIRTHYEAR = 1980;
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="operators">
      <header>Operators</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
          <br>
          In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
        </p>
        <code>
          int myNum = 100 + 50;
        </code>
        <p>
          Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used
        to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:
        </p>
        <code>
            int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
            int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
            int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
           </code>
        <p>C divides the operators into the following groups:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
          <li>Assignement Operators</li>
          <li>Comparison Operators</li>
          <li>Logical Operators</li>
          <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
        <p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.</p>
        <p>In the following example we are going to use the values :
          <code>
            int a = 5;
            int b = 10;

            // variable c is not declared
            int c;
           </code>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Addition: Two values are added together using the <span id="marked">+</span> operator. To calculate the value of c in this
              example, we must add a and b. We then display the outcome on the screen by using the printf() function.
            </p>
            <code>
                  #include &RightAngleBracket;stdio.h&LeftAngleBracket;
                  #include &RightAngleBracket;stdlib.h&LeftAngleBracket;

                    int main() {
                    &MediumSpace;int a = 5;
                    &MediumSpace;int b = 10;
                    &MediumSpace;int c = a + b;

                    &MediumSpace;printf("%d", c);

                    &MediumSpace;return 0;
                    }
                  //We have added a and b and stored the results in c
                  //15 will be printed out as the answer
              </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Subtraction: We subtract a value from another using the <span id="marked">-</span> operator in mathematics. Here, the value of c
              is obtained in this example by subtracting a from b. Then, we display the outcome on the screen by using
              the printf() function.
            </p>
            <code>
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdio.h&LeftAngleBracket;
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdlib.h&LeftAngleBracket;

                    int main() {
                    &MediumSpace;int a = 5;
                    &MediumSpace;int b = 10;
                    &MediumSpace;int c = b - a;

                    &MediumSpace;printf("%d", c);

                    &MediumSpace;return 0;
                    }
              </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Multiplication: Two numbers are multiplied by each other using the <span id="marked">*</span> operator. The value of c is obtained
              in this example by multiplying a and b. then we display the outcome on the screen by using the printf()
              function.</p>
            <code>
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdio.h&LeftAngleBracket;
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdlib.h&LeftAngleBracket;

                int main() {
                &MediumSpace;int a = 5;
                &MediumSpace;int b = 10;
                &MediumSpace;int c = a * b;

                &MediumSpace;printf("%d", c);

                &MediumSpace;return 0;
                }
              </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Division: To divide two values by each other, use the <span id="marked">/</span> operator. To determine the value of d in this
              example, we divide a by b. Be aware that we cast a and b to float in order to guarantee a result in
              floating-point. The output with two decimal places is then displayed on the screen using the printf()
              function.
            </p>
            <code>
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdio.h&LeftAngleBracket;
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdlib.h&LeftAngleBracket;

                int main() {
                &MediumSpace;int a = 5;
                &MediumSpace;int b = 10;
                &MediumSpace;int c = b / a;

                &MediumSpace;printf("%d", c);

                &MediumSpace;return 0;
                }
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Modulus: We use the <span id="marked">%</span> operator to determine the remaining part of a division operation. In this case, we
              divide a by b to get the remainder. If there is no leftover, then b is a factor of a. The printf()
              function is then used to show the outcome on the screen.</p>
            <code>
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdio.h&LeftAngleBracket;
              #include &RightAngleBracket;stdlib.h&LeftAngleBracket;

                int main() {
                &MediumSpace;int a = 5;
                &MediumSpace;int b = 2;
                &MediumSpace;int c = a % b;

                &MediumSpace;printf("%d", c);

                &MediumSpace;return 0;
                }
                //The remainder is the answer which in this case is 1.
